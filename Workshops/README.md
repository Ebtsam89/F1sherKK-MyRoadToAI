## Description
In the following repo I am storing **exercises and presentations I have prepared in order to teach Machine Learning and Deep Learning to others** on various occasions.

As preparation of this content took months **I would like show it to people personally** rather than just distribute it. All materials have been already used in real workshop sessions led by me.

**Every exercise has solution notebook included, so people can review it at home!**

I have provided small showcases of what content can be found inside.
